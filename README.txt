# Debuggerino

Small Mod that adds command versions of F3 + Keybind shortcuts, also adds an alias of commands such as /day and /night.
Practically the most uncalled for mod ever but sometimes pressing those keybinds at the same time can be really annoying. (To me at least)
 
/chunk-boundaries - Toggles chunk boundaries on and off.
/reload-chunks - Reload chunks your clients chunks
/clear-chat - Clears your chat
/quit - Closes Minecraft
/current-coords - Used to tell the player their coordinates
/F3-Help - Displays Vanillas help for F3 shortcuts
/fullscreen - Toggle fullscreen on and off without having to go into the menu
/hitboxes - Enables/Disables the render of Entity hotboxes
/resource-reload - Reload resources (Such as resourcepacks, textures, sounds etc etc)
/screenshot - Takes a screenshot
/tooltips - Enables/Disables 
 
 
/day - Set's the time to day. *
/night - Sets the time to night *
 
Commands marked with * will also work on a server (Although the server must also have this mod and you must have permission)
 
I will add more to this mod as times goes on, feel free to suggest things in the comments.
